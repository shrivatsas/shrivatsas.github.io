The internet has been abuzz with [Jeff's 2017 letter to shareholders](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312517120198/d373368dex991.htm) the last couple of days. It is an impressive, succinct piece with advice about proxies, external trends and customer obsession. I loved it too and read a couple more (older) shareholder letters .

When i think about it now what turned me on was the clarity of people on the move, the achievers and the super achievers amongst us. I doubt they have any fewer doubts than others. The distinction is in moving beyond and being in action while harbouring doubts, while others focus and freeze within those self-doubts.

Its time to be on the move.
