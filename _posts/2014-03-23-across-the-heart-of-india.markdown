Our idea of the journey was a kind of semi-backpacking tour, ie. we would plan only for the next day. MP was too big for our 10 day schedule, we restricted our exploration to south and west of MP, the Satpura and Malwa regions. Let us see how we did.

I was keen on travelling more across india after visiting mostly southern india over the past few years. Jan 2014 was when it all came together. I, Du and Santy chalked out a 10 day trip. But why MP? One of the few mass media ads that have got me interested is the Madhya pradesh tourism ad. Maybe because i knew nothing about MP and suddenly i was exposed to new possibilities through it. Madhya Pradesh, "The heart of incredible india" it was decided.

## Day 0: Getting there

We booked 3rd AC seats on Jan Shatabdi from Bangalore and reached Bhopal on the evening of Jan 3rd.

It was my first journey on a Jan Shatabdi and was impressed with the facilities and support that were "mandated" for the paying customers, the reality was a little different but that is topic of a different blogpost. As our train passed Itarsi, around 7pm, we started exploring places to stay at Bhopal. A couple of fellow passengers, bhopal residents, suggested we go to mp nagar and search around. Google suggested us some places around the old railway station at Hamidia road.

We, the tech people, followed google. Hotel Sonali regency has good user ratings on google and was cheap, we went there. Maybe not the worst decision we made, there were more to come later on.

## Day 1: Around Bhopal

Plan for Day 1 (a Sunday) was early morning bus to Sanchi, Udaygiri caves, come back and stroll to Taj-Ul-Masjid. Government inter-city bus transport services are almost non-existent. Most of the travel between towns happens by trains or alternatively slow and crowded private buses of various sizes.

We went to the private bus stand at Hamidia road and took a early morning bus to Sanchi.

First day, First show. Bus to Sanchi

**Sanchi**, a UNESCO world heritage site, lying atop a small hillock is a beautiful and well maintained place. We spent a 2-3 hours walking around the place and had breakfast in the local canteen. This was a good start.

Next up, **Udayagiri caves**, this was not prominent among the 'places to visit' in the tourism brochures and websites. But what the heck its not too far away from Sanchi. We bargained with an autorickshaw driver and went ahead. There were 2 things a big stone scultpure of the Varaha avatar of Vishnu (various other sculptures were a badly mangled mess), and a litter of puppies.

Du was badgering us the last 2 days for a meal at a dhaba. The driver dropped us off at a dhaba. A a stomachful of oily delicacies later we took a crowded bus back to our hotel room. A quick nap later around 5pm we started our walk to Taj-ul-masjid, through some narrow and smelly bylanes of old bhopal.

No mistakes here, **Taj-ul-masjid** is indeed the crown, a majestic place, long & wide flight of stairs to the big main entrance. Which was shuttered. Back down the long & wide flight of stairs, and went in through a side entrance. The big hallway with very attractive pillars looked enchanting in the moon light. The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj-ul-Masajid) does better justice to the place than this post.

Next we walked around the big upper lake, on towards MP nagar to have some sumptuous street food and took a local bus back to our hotel rooms. *Day 1 mission accomplished*.

## Day 2: Onwards, westwards

Day 2 plan, **Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka** and then to the **Queen of Satpuras, Panchmarhi**. As noted, depending on intercity bus transport is a bottomless pit in MP. Well we did not know better, we asked around and shuffled between bus stops. We finally did reach Obaidullagunj, a intersection on the highway, from there we took an auto to Bhimbetka. This was totally different to all the historical places i have visited, well yeah, because it is pre-historical. There wasn't much to click as the photographs would surely turn out grainy. I liked it and felt the journey was worth it, others perhaps not so much.

It was Du time again, he had been stealthily passing subliminal messages all this time about taking a ride on the passing trucks. We approach one guy as the truck is ready to hum after another dhaba lunch. He is heading towards nagpur, and agrees to take us up. In the meantime the private bus which we were supposed to take passes us by, as we stare out our windows. We arrive slowly at Hoshangabad, the next big town. Its been one hour since the bus had passed us. We jump off the truck and run to the bus stand. Here the good deeds of our life await us, the bus is here in its first gear, ready to go, waiting for us. We reach Pipariya, the next town, its 8pm and the bus stops, hold your breadth, for 45 minutes. Now we know why this bus takes 6 hours to travel 200kms from bhopal to panchmarhi, crazy. We finally reached Panchmarhi, 10 or 11pm, we did not care any more. Went straight to Hotel Highlands and settled in.

## Day 3: Panchmarhi

There are lots of these neat little view points around panchmarhi like dolphin nose, lamb's rock, ooty lake. Hold on, are we in ooty or panchmarhi!? Sorry, there are the correspondingly named places in panchmarhi. Frankly i think Du's idea was better, we should have picked up some cycles and of course cycled around this luscious beautiful place. Opportunity missed. We started random time and money calculations, should we go somewhere else? Kanha? Jabalpur & Bedaghat? or finish MP quickly and go to Ajanta & Ellora on the way back? Our journey derailed a little here.

## Day 4: Towards the Narmada

We decided the Ajanta & Ellora option, started out from Panchmarhi the next morning to go to Omkareshwar, Maheshwar and Mandu/Mandav. A bus to Itarsi later, we did not find sufficient digits to fully evaluate the various train combinations to the next destination. We spent the next 8 hours in the dusty town, waiting in the courtyard of a local school for the sun to set. We had booked a overnight bus, and now we got to see it. It was bad, the 'very' kind of bad. Got in, it took us to bhopal and dropped us at indore. We had a 2 hour morning nap in a small, smelly room for 700 rupees. (Is there a Yo way of saying rupees? i don't like bucks).

Our next crowded bus took us to **Omkareshwar**, a godly place with a gorgeous narmada. We visited both the temples and had sumptuous meal at the Bhojanalaya. After much haggling we booked an auto to take us to **Maheshwar** and onto **Mandav** later. Maheshwar is a beautiful place situated by the narmada. A simple museum dedicated to Rajmata Ahilyabai and the holkars is nearby. Here Du took a dip in the river to wash away his sins, or maybe just sweat. By the way, did you ask, what about Santy? He was just gliding along the whole trip until his pant was on fire. Now that is for later. Onto Mandav then, our miscalculations are back, we reached there by 6:15pm and all the places were about to close or had just closed. Located on a beautiful hillside, we just got a caught the silhoutte of the various structures al around the place, those glimpses were good enough to convey that we missed something beautiful.

It was a pleasure to visit these last 3 places and i wish i would be able to wander across them again in the future.

## Day 5: Cross the border, heading home

The next dirty overnight bus took us across the border to Aurangabad, my cousin Aditya was there to pick us up and we had a nice homely breakfast after a lot of oily but tasty dhaba food. He had arranged for a cab and we were on our way to Ellora caves and Daulatabad Fort. The rock cuttings at **Ellora** were magnificient in their grandeur, 30+ wondrous caves among them temples, and places to talk, stay, eat and entertain. The *unrivalled centerpiece of the place is Kailasa or Kailasanatha*, also from Wikipedia,

*The Nandi Mandapa stands on 16 pillars and is 29.3 m high. The base of the Nandi Mandapa has been carved to suggest that life-sized elephants are holding the structure aloft. The construction of this cave was a feat of human genius â€“ it entailed the removal of 200,000 tonnes of rock, and took 100 years to complete.*

Unreal.

!["Kailasa temple @Ellora"](http://shrivatsas.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/kailasa-ellora.jpg "Kailasa temple @Ellora")

We couldn't really visit **Daulatabad Fort**, just had a brief stroll and santy rushed us back home. Santy was on fire now for the simple matter he found that very morning there was a single direct KSRTC bus from Aurangabad to Bijapur at 7 in the evening and he was desperate to get on it and head home. He did. I and Du had a big dinnerÂ with Aditya, Aparna vahini, Anoushka and took an overnight bus to kolhapur. That pretty much sums up our trip, bus rides from nowhere to nowhere!

Was it worth it?
